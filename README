 About this README
------------------------------------------------------------

This README is intended to provide quick and to-the-point documentation for
technical users intending to compile parts of Guacamole themselves.

Distribution-specific packages are available from the files section of the main
project page:
 
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/guacamole/files/

Distribution-specific documentation is provided on the Guacamole wiki:

    http://guac-dev.org/


------------------------------------------------------------
 What is libguac?
------------------------------------------------------------

libguac is the core library for guacd (the Guacamole proxy) and any protocol
support plugins for guacd.

libguac provides efficient buffered I/O of text and base64 data, as well as
somewhat abstracted functions for sending Guacamole instructions.


------------------------------------------------------------
 Compiling and installing libguac
------------------------------------------------------------

Please note that distribution-specific pre-compiled packages are available from
the files section of the main project site:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/guacamole/files/

libguac is built using the popular GNU Automake, and thus provides the standard
configure script.

1) Run configure

    $ ./configure

    Assuming all dependencies have been installed, this should succeed without
    errors.

2) Run make

    $ make

    libguac will now compile.

3) Install (as root)

    # make install

    libguac will install to your /usr/local/lib directory by default. You can
    change the install location by using the --prefix option for configure.

    Several header files will also be installed to
    /usr/local/include/guacamole.

    You will need to run ldconfig (as root) so that the library can be found
    when guacd is run:

    # ldconfig
